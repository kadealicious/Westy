generate ssao on gpu alone by referencing normal buffer.  The farther the distance between a neighboring fragment's normal, the more occluded this fragment gets.  Also need to reference depth buffer, in case the neighbor fragment is far away.  Could potentially by faster than sampled ssao, while also providing a per-pixel level of detail.  Will probably need a bias as well to get rid of any artifacting.
